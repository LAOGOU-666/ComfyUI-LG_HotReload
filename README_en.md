An extension for ComfyUI that allows hot reloading. Once installed, you can preview changes in real-time while developing custom nodes or installing plugins without restarting ComfyUI.

## Main Features

- üîÑ Real-time hot reloading: Automatically reload nodes after modifying code
- üéØ Intelligent monitoring: Only monitor specified file types and directories
- üöÄ Instant updates: Frontend interface automatically refreshes to display the latest changes
- üõ°Ô∏è Debounce design: Avoid performance issues caused by frequent reloads
- üìÅ Support for web files: Automatically sync the web directory content of nodes
- üîç Route hot reloading: Support real-time updates for API routes

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to the `custom_nodes` directory of ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/LAOGOU-666/ComfyUI-LG-HotReload.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ComfyUI-LG-HotReload
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start ComfyUI
4. Begin editing your custom nodes. After saving, it will automatically reload; you just need to reset the nodes or refresh the webpage (this is just a plugin, there are no physical nodes, once installed you don't need to worry about it, the backend handles it automatically).

## Notes

- It is recommended to use in a development environment; please be cautious in production environments.
- Some complex changes may still require restarting ComfyUI.
- Ensure your code has no syntax errors, as this may affect the reloading process.
